=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Backend> is an abstract base class for L<Minion> backends, like L<Minion::Backend::Pg>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion::Backend> implements the following attributes.

=head2 minion

  my $minion = $backend->minion;
  $backend   = $backend->minion(Minion->new);

L<Minion> object this backend belongs to. Note that this attribute is weakened.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion::Backend> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::Base> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 auto_retry_job

  my $bool = $backend->auto_retry_job($job_id, $retries, $attempts);

Automatically L</"retry"> job with L<Minion/"backoff"> if there are attempts left, used to implement backends like
L<Minion::Backend::Pg>.

=head2 broadcast

  my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command');
  my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command', [@args]);
  my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command', [@args], [$id1, $id2, $id3]);

Broadcast remote control command to one or more workers. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

=head2 dequeue

  my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5);
  my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5, {queues => ['important']});

Wait a given amount of time in seconds for a job, dequeue it and transition from C<inactive> to C<active> state, or
return C<undef> if queues were empty. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item min_priority

  min_priority => 3

Do not dequeue jobs with a lower priority.
