=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> starts a L<Minion> worker. You can have as many workers as you like.

=head1 WORKER SIGNALS

The L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> process can be controlled at runtime with the following signals.

=head2 INT, TERM

Stop gracefully after finishing the current jobs.

=head2 QUIT

Stop immediately without finishing the current jobs.

=head1 JOB SIGNALS

The job processes spawned by the L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> process can be controlled at runtime with the
following signals.

=head2 INT, TERM

This signal starts out with the operating system default and allows for jobs to install a custom signal handler to stop
gracefully.

=head2 USR1, USR2

These signals start out being ignored and allow for jobs to install custom signal handlers.

=head1 REMOTE CONTROL COMMANDS

The L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> process can be controlled at runtime through L<Minion::Command::minion::job>,
from anywhere in the network, by broadcasting the following remote control commands.

=head2 jobs

  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b jobs -a '[10]'
  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b jobs -a '[10]' 23

Instruct one or more workers to change the number of jobs to perform concurrently. Setting this value to C<0> will
effectively pause the worker. That means all current jobs will be finished, but no new ones accepted, until the number
is increased again.

=head2 kill

  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b kill -a '["INT", 10025]'
  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b kill -a '["INT", 10025]' 23

Instruct one or more workers to send a signal to a job that is currently being performed. This command will be ignored
by workers that do not have a job matching the id. That means it is safe to broadcast this command to all workers.

=head2 stop

  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b stop -a '[10025]'
  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b stop -a '[10025]' 23

Instruct one or more workers to stop a job that is currently being performed immediately. This command will be ignored
by workers that do not have a job matching the id. That means it is safe to broadcast this command to all workers.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> inherits all attributes from L<Mojolicious::Command> and implements the following
new ones.

=head2 description

  my $description = $worker->description;
  $worker         = $worker->description('Foo');

Short description of this command, used for the command list.

=head2 usage

  my $usage = $worker->usage;
  $worker   = $worker->usage('Foo');

Usage information for this command, used for the help screen.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> inherits all methods from L<Mojolicious::Command> and implements the following new
ones.

=head2 run

  $worker->run(@ARGV);

Run this command.
