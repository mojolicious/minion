=head1 DESCRIPTION

=begin html

<p>
  <img alt="Screenshot" src="https://raw.github.com/mojolicious/minion/main/examples/admin.png?raw=true" width="600px">
</p>

=end html

L<Minion> is a high performance job queue for the Perl programming language, with support for multiple named queues,
priorities, high priority fast lane, delayed jobs, job dependencies, job progress, job results, retries with backoff,
rate limiting, unique jobs, expiring jobs, statistics, distributed workers, parallel processing, autoscaling, remote
control, L<Mojolicious|https://mojolicious.org> admin ui, resource leak protection and multiple backends (such as
L<PostgreSQL|https://www.postgresql.org>).

Job queues allow you to process time and/or computationally intensive tasks in background processes, outside of the
request/response lifecycle of web applications. Among those tasks you'll commonly find image resizing, spam filtering,
HTTP downloads, building tarballs, warming caches and basically everything else you can imagine that's not super fast.

Take a look at our excellent documentation in L<Minion::Guide>!

=head1 EXAMPLES

This distribution also contains a great example application you can use for inspiration. The L<link
checker|https://github.com/mojolicious/minion/tree/main/examples/linkcheck> will show you how to integrate background
jobs into well-structured L<Mojolicious> applications.

=head1 EVENTS

L<Minion> inherits all events from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and can emit the following new ones.

=head2 enqueue

  $minion->on(enqueue => sub ($minion, $id) {
    ...
  });

Emitted after a job has been enqueued, in the process that enqueued it.

  $minion->on(enqueue => sub ($minion, $id) {
    say "Job $id has been enqueued.";
  });

=head2 worker

  $minion->on(worker => sub ($minion, $worker) {
    ...
  });

Emitted in the worker process after it has been created.

  $minion->on(worker => sub ($minion, $worker) {
    say "Worker $$ started.";
  });

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion> implements the following attributes.

=head2 app

  my $app = $minion->app;
  $minion = $minion->app(MyApp->new);

Application for job queue, defaults to a L<Mojo::HelloWorld> object. Note that this attribute is weakened.

=head2 backend

  my $backend = $minion->backend;
  $minion     = $minion->backend(Minion::Backend::Pg->new);

Backend, usually a L<Minion::Backend::Pg> object.

=head2 backoff

  my $cb  = $minion->backoff;
  $minion = $minion->backoff(sub {...});

A callback used to calculate the delay for automatically retried jobs, defaults to C<(retries ** 4) + 15> (15, 16, 31,
96, 271, 640...), which means that roughly C<25> attempts can be made in C<21> days.

  $minion->backoff(sub ($retries) {
    return ($retries ** 4) + 15 + int(rand 30);
  });

=head2 missing_after

  my $after = $minion->missing_after;
  $minion   = $minion->missing_after(172800);

Amount of time in seconds after which workers without a heartbeat will be considered missing and removed from the
registry by L</"repair">, defaults to C<1800> (30 minutes).

=head2 remove_after

  my $after = $minion->remove_after;
  $minion   = $minion->remove_after(86400);

Amount of time in seconds after which jobs that have reached the state C<finished> and have no unresolved dependencies
will be removed automatically by L</"repair">, defaults to C<172800> (2 days). It is not recommended to set this value
below 2 days.

=head2 stuck_after

  my $after = $minion->stuck_after;
  $minion   = $minion->stuck_after(86400);

Amount of time in seconds after which jobs that have not been processed will be considered stuck by L</"repair"> and
transition to the C<failed> state, defaults to C<172800> (2 days).

=head2 tasks

  my $tasks = $minion->tasks;
  $minion   = $minion->tasks({foo => sub {...}});

Registered tasks.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 add_task

  $minion = $minion->add_task(foo => sub {...});
  $minion = $minion->add_task(foo => 'MyApp::Task::Foo');

Register a task, which can be a closure or a custom L<Minion::Job> subclass. Note that support for custom task classes
is B<EXPERIMENTAL> and might change without warning!

  # Job with result
  $minion->add_task(add => sub ($job, $first, $second) {
    $job->finish($first + $second);
  });
  my $id = $minion->enqueue(add => [1, 1]);
  my $result = $minion->job($id)->info->{result};

=head2 broadcast

  my $bool = $minion->broadcast('some_command');
  my $bool = $minion->broadcast('some_command', [@args]);
  my $bool = $minion->broadcast('some_command', [@args], [$id1, $id2, $id3]);

Broadcast remote control command to one or more workers.

  # Broadcast "stop" command to all workers to kill job 10025
  $minion->broadcast('stop', [10025]);

  # Broadcast "kill" command to all workers to interrupt job 10026
  $minion->broadcast('kill', ['INT', 10026]);

  # Broadcast "jobs" command to pause worker 23
  $minion->broadcast('jobs', [0], [23]);

=head2 class_for_task

  my $class = $minion->class_for_task('foo');

Return job class for task. Note that this method is B<EXPERIMENTAL> and might change without warning!

=head2 enqueue

  my $id = $minion->enqueue('foo');
  my $id = $minion->enqueue(foo => [@args]);
  my $id = $minion->enqueue(foo => [@args] => {priority => 1});

Enqueue a new job with C<inactive> state. Arguments get serialized by the L</"backend"> (often with L<Mojo::JSON>), so
you shouldn't send objects and be careful with binary data, nested data structures with hash and array references are
fine though.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item attempts

  attempts => 25

Number of times performing this job will be attempted, with a delay based on L</"backoff"> after the first attempt,
defaults to C<1>.

=item delay

  delay => 10

Delay job for this many seconds (from now), defaults to C<0>.

=item expire

  expire => 300

Job is valid for this many seconds (from now) before it expires.

=item lax

  lax => 1

Existing jobs this job depends on may also have transitioned to the C<failed> state to allow for it to be processed,
defaults to C<false>. Note that this option is B<EXPERIMENTAL> and might change without warning!

=item notes

  notes => {foo => 'bar', baz => [1, 2, 3]}

Hash reference with arbitrary metadata for this job that gets serialized by the L</"backend"> (often with
L<Mojo::JSON>), so you shouldn't send objects and be careful with binary data, nested data structures with hash and
array references are fine though.

=item parents

  parents => [$id1, $id2, $id3]

One or more existing jobs this job depends on, and that need to have transitioned to the state C<finished> before it
can be processed.

=item priority

  priority => 5

Job priority, defaults to C<0>. Jobs with a higher priority get performed first. Priorities can be positive or negative,
but should be in the range between C<100> and C<-100>.

=item queue

  queue => 'important'

Queue to put job in, defaults to C<default>.

=back

=head2 foreground

  my $bool = $minion->foreground($id);

Retry job in C<minion_foreground> queue, then perform it right away with a temporary worker in this process, very
useful for debugging.

=head2 guard

  my $guard = $minion->guard('foo', 3600);
  my $guard = $minion->guard('foo', 3600, {limit => 20});

Same as L</"lock">, but returns a scope guard object that automatically releases the lock as soon as the object is
destroyed, or C<undef> if aquiring the lock failed.

  # Only one job should run at a time (unique job)
  $minion->add_task(do_unique_stuff => sub ($job, @args) {
    return $job->finish('Previous job is still active')
      unless my $guard = $minion->guard('fragile_backend_service', 7200);
    ...
  });

  # Only five jobs should run at a time and we try again later if necessary
  $minion->add_task(do_concurrent_stuff => sub ($job, @args) {
    return $job->retry({delay => 30})

=head2 jobs

  my $jobs = $minion->jobs;
  my $jobs = $minion->jobs({states => ['inactive']});

Return L<Minion::Iterator> object to safely iterate through job information.

  # Iterate through jobs for two tasks
  my $jobs = $minion->jobs({tasks => ['foo', 'bar']});
  while (my $info = $jobs->next) {
    say "$info->{id}: $info->{state}";
  }

  # Remove all failed jobs from a named queue
  my $jobs = $minion->jobs({states => ['failed'], queues => ['unimportant']});
  while (my $info = $jobs->next) {
    $minion->job($info->{id})->remove;
  }

  # Count failed jobs for a task
  say $minion->jobs({states => ['failed'], tasks => ['foo']})->total;

=head2 lock

  my $bool = $minion->lock('foo', 3600);
  my $bool = $minion->lock('foo', 3600, {limit => 20});

Try to acquire a named lock that will expire automatically after the given amount of time in seconds. You can release
the lock manually with L</"unlock"> to limit concurrency, or let it expire for rate limiting. For convenience you can
also use L</"guard"> to release the lock automatically, even if the job failed.

  # Only one job should run at a time (unique job)
  $minion->add_task(do_unique_stuff => sub ($job, @args) {
    return $job->finish('Previous job is still active')
      unless $minion->lock('fragile_backend_service', 7200);
    ...
    $minion->unlock('fragile_backend_service');
  });

  # Only five jobs should run at a time and we wait for our turn
  $minion->add_task(do_concurrent_stuff => sub ($job, @args) {
    sleep 1 until $minion->lock('some_web_service', 60, {limit => 5});
    ...
    $minion->unlock('some_web_service');
  });

  # Only a hundred jobs should run per hour and we try again later if necessary
  $minion->add_task(do_rate_limited_stuff => sub ($job, @args) {
    return $job->retry({delay => 3600})
      unless $minion->lock('another_web_service', 3600, {limit => 100});
    ...
  });

An expiration time of C<0> can be used to check if a named lock could have been acquired without creating one.

  # Check if the lock "foo" could have been acquired
  say 'Lock could have been acquired' unless $minion->lock('foo', 0);

Or to simply check if a named lock already exists you can also use L</"is_locked">.

=back

=head2 result_p

  my $promise = $minion->result_p($id);
  my $promise = $minion->result_p($id, {interval => 5});

Return a L<Mojo::Promise> object for the result of a job. The state C<finished> will result in the promise being
C<fullfilled>, and the state C<failed> in the promise being C<rejected>. This operation can be cancelled by resolving
the promise manually at any time.

  # Enqueue job and receive the result at some point in the future
  my $id = $minion->enqueue('foo');
  $minion->result_p($id)->then(sub ($info) {
    my $result = ref $info ? $info->{result} : 'Job already removed';
